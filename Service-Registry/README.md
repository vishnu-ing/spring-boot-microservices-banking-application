# Service Registry

## Introduction
The Service Registry is a critical component in a microservices architecture, responsible for service discovery. It allows microservices to register themselves at runtime and discover other registered services.

## Technologies Used

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot is used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the configuration and deployment process by providing a set of default configurations and a wide range of features such as embedded servers, security, and monitoring.

### Eureka Server
Eureka Server is a service registry used for service discovery. It allows microservices to register themselves at runtime and discover other registered services.

## API Endpoints
The Service Registry does not expose any custom API endpoints. It provides a web interface for monitoring registered services.

## Error Handling
The Service Registry uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Common status codes include:
- "200 OK" - The request was successful.
- "400 Bad Request" - The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- "404 Not Found" - The requested resource was not found.
- "500 Internal Server Error" - An error occurred on the server.

## Security
The Service Registry can be secured using Spring Security. Authentication and authorization can be configured to protect the registry and its endpoints.

## Configuration
The service configuration is managed using Spring Cloud Config, which allows for centralized and externalized configuration management across all microservices.

## Monitoring
Spring Boot Actuator is used for monitoring and managing the application. It provides various endpoints to check the health, metrics, and other operational information of the service.

## Logging
Logging is configured using Logback, which is the default logging framework in Spring Boot. It provides powerful and flexible logging capabilities.

## Testing
JUnit and Mockito are used for unit and integration testing. These frameworks provide a comprehensive set of tools for writing and running tests.

## Build and Deployment
The project uses Maven for build automation and dependency management. The service can be packaged as a Docker container for deployment in a containerized environment.
